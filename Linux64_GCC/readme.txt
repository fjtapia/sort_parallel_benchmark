==============
You have tw kind of test
  a) Simple benchmark : show the time spent by each algorithm in the sorting
                        For to compile  and run the programs execute the shell script 
                        compile_and_run.sh

                        The compilation need around 3 , 4 minutes.
                        The execution need between 5 to 20 minutes depending of your processor.
                        When finish , the results are in the file Results.txt

  b) Detailed benchmark : Show the time spent by each algorithm and the memory used 
                          This benchmark is slower than the previous and have 3 programs
                          
                          benchmark_numbers.sh compile and run of the sorting of 100000000 64 bits numbers
                          The results are in the file Results_Numbers.txt

                          benchmark_strings.sh compile and run of the sorting of 10000000 strings
                          The results are in the file Results_Strings.txt

                          benchmark_objects.sh compile and run of the sorting of objects of different sizes
                          The results are in the file Results_Objects.txt
